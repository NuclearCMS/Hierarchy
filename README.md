This package is intended for [Nuclear CMS](https://github.com/NuclearCMS/Nuclear) and it constitutes its main content management and content type management functionality. It is developed separately to enable individual development and possible reuse.

## Installation
Installing Hierarchy is simple.

1. Pull this package in through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).
    ```js
    {
        "require": {
            "nuclear/hierarchy": "1.2.*"
        }
    }
    ```

2. In order to register Hierarchy Service Provider add `'Nuclear\Hierarchy\Providers\HierarchyServiceProvider'` to the end of `providers` array in your `config/app.php` file.
    ```php
    'providers' => array(
    
        'Illuminate\Foundation\Providers\ArtisanServiceProvider',
        'Illuminate\Auth\AuthServiceProvider',
        ...
        'Nuclear\Hierarchy\Providers\HierarchyServiceProvider',
    
    ),
    ```
    
3. Publish the migrations and configuration file.
    ```bash
        php artisan vendor:publish
    ```
    Do not forget to migrate the database.

4. Finally, register the autoloader in your composer.json file and use `composer dump-autoload` command.
    ```json
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "gen\\": "gen/"
        }
    },
    ```
    This is essential for using the entities that are generated by Hierarchy.
